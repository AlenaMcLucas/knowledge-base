    "- When something is imported, its file is run\n",

    "    - Not good in the majority of cases because if it's called from another script, it will throw an error.\n",
    "- There will be errors if you attempt circular imports\n",
    "    - Can bypass this problem by importing the entire module and not something specific since Python keeps track of importing specific modules\n",
    "\n",
    "Different types of imports:\n",
    "    \n",
    "- When you run a file as a script, for that script `__name__ == __main__`\n",
    "- When you import a script as a module, its `__name__ == [path]`, where `[absolute path]` could be `utils.find`\n",
    "- When you **relatively import children** as a module (`from .common.file_operations import save_to_file`), its `__name__ == [absolute path]`, where `[path]` could be `utils.common.file_operations`\n",
    "- When you **relatively import a parent** as a module (`from ..find import NotFoundError`), its `__name__ == [absolute path]`, where `[path]` could be `utils.find`\n",
    "    - Note that if you run the script itself, it will likely throw an error\n",
    "- Great Stack Overflow explanation: [Relative imports for the billionth time](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14132789/relative-imports-for-the-billionth-time/14132912#14132912)\n",

    "In practice:\n",
    "\n",

    "- Relative imports make it tough to run files as scripts, so a best practice for beginners are absolute imports\n",
    "- `if __name__ == '__main__':` is the best way to test the functionality of your file"
