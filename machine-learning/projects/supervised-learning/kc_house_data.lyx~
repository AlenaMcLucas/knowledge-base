\begin_layout Title
King County House Sales
\end_layout

\begin_layout Date
December 20th, 2016
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
This is my first time merging Python, R, and LyX together to test my ability
 to perform basic data science, and specifically machine learning, functions
 and format the results and proceeding analysis at a competitve level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The data set for King County house sales has information between May 2014
 to May 2015.
 It contains 21 variables and 21,613 observations.
 This dataset is hosted on Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/harlfoxem/housesalespr
ediction released Under CC0: Public Domain License.

\begin_layout Standard
Using just this data, use feature engineering and machine learning to build
 a model that predicts housing prices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Data Exploration
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Univariate Analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Explore each variable by category, noting what will need to be addressed
 when feature engineering.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the purposes of this project, I will not be using the following variables:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
id: This variable assigns an identification number to each home, which will
 not be useful for machine learning.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
date: Working with dates is out of the scope of this introductory project.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
sqft_living15 & sqft_lot15: There is no information about what these variables
 mean, and so without interpretation they are not needed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Continuous Variables
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here are the measures of central tendency and dispersion for the continuous
 variables, along with the number of missing values each variable has:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All of these variables are skewed right as the mean is greater than or equal
 to the median, which is greater than or equal to the mode.
 Because the median is less sensitive to outliers, it is likely the best
 measure of central tendency.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this case, the average house price is $450,000, with 1,910 sqft of home
 on a 7,618 sqft lot.
 The sqft above in these homes are approximately 1,560, and they were more
 likely to not have a basement.
 There are two other varibles that are difficult to interpret as there is
 very limited information about the dataset available.
 At first, they appear to be the sqft of the home and lot at the end of
 2015, but looking at the range the huge fluction does not make sense.
 To be determined.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Looking at the ranges for each of the variables, feature scaling will be
 required to ensure variables on a larger scale do not affect variables
 that are not.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because there is no confirmation that these are all King Count house sales,
 the data has been treated as a sample of the population, with one degree
 of freedom calculated in both the variance and standard deviation.
 All standard deviations are high, which is consistent with the finding
 that every variable is skewed with a significant number of outliers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lastly, there are no missing values for any variables.
 It is worth noting, if a house does not have a basement, its square feet
 are zero and not null.
 Looking at its IQR, over 50% of homes don't have basements.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Categorical / Discrete Variables
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here are the summary statistics for the categorical variables:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are 13 different categories for number of bedrooms, with most homes
 having three or four.
 There is an outlier of 33 bedrooms, which could be a mansion or a clerical
 error.
 There are 30 categories for number of bathrooms, which likely will need
 binning to strengthen the abiliy to predict housing prices.
 With the vast majority of homes having 1 or 2 floors, there are a few that
 have half and/or 3 stories.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A home either has a waterfront view or doesn't, with only 163 out of 21,613
 having one.
 There is some kind of scale with which to evaluate the view of a home,
 which was not provided with the dataset, but it ranges from 0 to 4 with
 90% scoring a 0.
 There is a similar scale from 1 to 5 for evaluating a home's condition
 with 65% scoring 3, 26% scoring 4 and 8% scoring 5.
 Grade ranges from 1 to 13 with 14% scoring 7, 28% scoring 8 and 12% scoring
 9.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are 116 different years that homes were built in spanning 1900 to
 2015 with no one year having more than 3% of homes, so this categorical
 variable will need binning.
 Also there are 70 different years that homes have been renovated in, but
 96% have not had a major renovation.
 This variable might be better suited as a boolean wiht 0 as not renovated
 and 1 as renovated.
 There are 70 unique zipcodes which will need to be binned.
 Looking at the ranges for latitude and logitude, they are so small they
 will certainly require feature scaling.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Conclusions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This dataset is atypical in that there are no missing values.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Bivariate Analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is skipped because there isn't a full understanding now, much research
 is required and I'm going to lose steam if I don't get to some feature
 engineering and machine learning!
